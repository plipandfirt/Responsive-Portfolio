      <p>Laurie Anderson is a Project Manager, with 20 years of experience inspiring teams to reach for excellence.</p>

      <p>In 2018, she stepped out of her comfort zone to explore an opportunity as a Full Stack developer. The opportunity is exciting and terrifying. If she is successful, this could be a wonderful next chapter.</p>

      <p>Laurie lives in New Hampshire with several four-legged creatures. She is a DIY junkie, Australian Cattle dog fanatic, and an aspiring Master Gardener.</p>

      <p>When she needs to recharge she retreats to the woods, forever searching for the perfect fishing hole.</p>
